# MicroservicesProject
Customer and CustomerOrder
This project consists of two microservices which are tested running. It requires a Eureka client to be up and running to connect these two services.
Once both the microservices are registered to Eureka, using Swagger they can be deployed.
We can use GET, POST, PUT, DELETE REST methods to call data from the MySQL database. The REST template allows both the Microservices to communicate with each other.
